# Third-Party Lists

> Third-party Listing & Tracking support is still being improved. As of now, NineAnimator can only
> present limited amount of information (among the data retrieved) with no review & rating
> capabilities. Later updates will bring support to those functions.

NineAnimator can present information on a selection of third party listing websites. You can configure
NineAnimator to push local playback history to those tracking services.

The tracking services can be configured in the `Settings` menu, under the `Anime Tracking Services`
submenu in the `Data and Privacy` section.
